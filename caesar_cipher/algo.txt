Caesar Cipher, each character in a text is shifted either upwards or downwards by the given key, if the key is 3 and the character is 'A' then the shift will be 'D' to reverse the shift, we need to perform the reverse shift that is -3 to 'D' which results in 'A' again.
	'A' => 3 => 'D' => -3 => 'A'
We can have key values from 0 to 25 shifts. Because we have only 26 letters in the alphabet. For example, 'A' => 25 => 'Z' => '-25' => 'A', if the key is 26 we need to start from 0 again.

Plan:
Input - Encryption & Decryption: text & Key 
Output - Depending on the context but text (encypted or decrypted)

Pseudo Code:
	- Get the text from user
	- Get the key from user
	- Covert the key to mod 26
	- Split the text into separate characters
	- Loop through splitted text
	- Convert the character to the equialent number value
	- Apply key to the number value mod by the range 
	- Because we have both upper and lower case values they have specific range in number values we do not exceed or go low
	- Convert the number back to character it represents
	- Join the splitted text back to text from
	- Print the result
